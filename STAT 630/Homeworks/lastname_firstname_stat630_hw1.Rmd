```

1.  [1 point] If you have not done so already, create an R Project for STAT 630 on your personal computer. Ideally, this will be inside a folder dedicated to this class.

    a.  Create a folder called `hw` in this R Project

    a.  Create a folder called `data` in this R Project

    a.  Create a folder called `images` in this R Project

    To get credit for this question, take a screenshot of your Files window in RStudio. Save the image in your `images` folder and replace my example image below with your screenshot. Note, your STAT 630 R Project can/should contain your own folder structure. Just make sure you have `hw`, `data`, and `images` folders somewhere in there.

2.  [1 point] Github. If you have not already done so, create a profile on [GitHub](https://github.com). Make sure to choose a professional profile name. It is very difficult to change your profile name on GitHub later, so choose wisely! Submit a link to your GitHub profile below.

3.  Choose **one** of the research questions below and answer the following questions.
    a. [2 points] Describe which type of study you would perform. Choose observational study or experiment, then describe your study in more detail *in a few sentences*.
    a. [2 points] Which variables would you collect? List (a) the variable and (b) it's type, i.e., specify quantitative (discrete or continuous) or categorical (ordinal or nominal).
        - **Predictor of interest**:
        - **Outcome**:
        - **Confounding**:

_Research Questions. Choose one:_

*   **Does smoking cause under eye bags?** A medical researcher conjectures that smoking can result in wrinkled skin around the eyes.
*   **Does wearing a Fitbit increase the amount of exercise people do per week?**
*   **Is your dominant hand stronger?** An instrument has been developed to measure the force exerted (in pounds) when squeezed by one hand.
*   **Do Queer faculty at Stanford earn the same as non-queer faculty?**
*   **What percentage of small businesses are Black-owned?**

4. Install the `openintro` package, by uncommenting the following code. 

*Reminder: you only have to do this once- like installing an app on your phone. After you run this line of code, either **comment** it out using `#`, or just delete it.*

```{r}
#install.packages("openintro")
```

After installing the R package for our book, load it, i.e., open the app!

```{r}
library(openintro) # Load the package
```

Load in the `babies` dataset. Use the help file to learn more.

```{r}
data(babies) # Load the data
?babies # View the help file
```

View a summary of the dataset.
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(babies) # Glimpse the dataset
summary(babies) # View a summary of each column (variable)
```

    a. [1 point] What does each row in the table represent?
    b. [1 point] How many participants were in the study?
    c. [2 points] All variables are coded as integers. Which variables should be recoded as *factors*? How would you code the *levels* of these factors?
